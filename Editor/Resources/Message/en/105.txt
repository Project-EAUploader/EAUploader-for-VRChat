<txt>
<size=14>    If the avatar you wish to upload is VRM, you will need to convert it. Please convert it from the list on the Import tab or the Setup tab.
    If an avatar that is supposed to be compatible with VRChat does not appear, it is likely that for some reason it is no longer compatible. Try asking for help in the community or elsewhere.</size>
