<size=16>    If the avatar you wish to upload is VRM, you will need to convert it. Please select your avatar in the Setup tab and press "Convert to Avatar for VRChat" in the Edit Tools to convert it.
    If you cannot select / cannot see your avatar, it means that your avatar cannot be uploaded to VRChat. if it is a VRChat compatible avatar, try deleting it and re-importing it again. If this does not solve the problem, ask questions in the community or elsewhere.</size>
