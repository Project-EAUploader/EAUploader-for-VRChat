<t>Avatar Validation</t>
<txt>
<size=16>    VRChat gives avatars a rating of 5 based on their load. Players can hide avatars based on this rating, and loaded avatars may not be visible to some players.
    Also, there are various restrictions on avatars for Android (Quest / smartphones), and avatars that exceed these restrictions will not be allowed. Also, avatars will not be visible to Quest standalone and Android users.

Light <<< <b><color=green>Excellent</color> < <color=green>Good</color> < <color=orange>Medium</color> < <color=red>Poor</color> < <color=red>Very Poor</color></b> <<< Heavy

<b>    The overall rating of the avatar is the value of the Overall: at the top.</b>
    VRChat recommends optimizing to Good, but you can also upload Very Poor with no problem; if you want to use VRChat on Quest alone or from a smartphone, please have an Android-compatible avatar.

<t>Optimization (weight reduction)</t>
<txt>
<size=16>    By installing AvatarOptimizer, EAUploader allows you to use the auto-optimization feature.
    Please install AvatarOptimizer from the Avatar Optimization menu on the right. Note that since the result of auto-optimization is not known until the build, this performance display will not reflect the post-optimization even if the auto-optimization function is turned on. If you want to further optimize or lighten the weight, please use the Unity editor and try the various functions in AvatarOptimizer.
