<t>Avatar Validation</t>
<txt>
<size=16>    VRChat gives avatars a rating of 5 based on their load. Players can hide avatars based on this rating, and loaded avatars may not be visible to some players.
    Also, there are various restrictions on avatars for Android (Quest / smartphones), and avatars that exceed these restrictions will not be allowed. Also, avatars will not be visible to Quest standalone and Android users.

Light <<< <b><color=green>Excellent</color> < <color=green>Good</color> < <color=orange>Medium</color> < <color=red>Poor</color> < <color=red>Very Poor</color></b> <<< Heavy

<b>    The overall rating of the avatar is the value of the Overall: at the top.</b>
    VRChat recommends optimizing to Good, but you can also upload Very Poor with no problem; if you want to use VRChat on Quest alone or from a smartphone, please have an Android-compatible avatar.

<t>Optimization (weight reduction)</t>
<txt>
<size=16>    Currently EAUploader does not have an avatar optimization feature.
    If you want to minimize your avatar, you will need to install a minimization tool such as Avatar optimizer and do it in the Unity editor.
