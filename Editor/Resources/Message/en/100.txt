<size=20>　The avatar file formats that the tool can handle are <color=red>.prefab</color> and <color=red>.unitypackage</color>. Many of the avatars distributed are in this format.
Press the button to open the Explorer. Select an avatar and import it.
If you want to use <color=green>VRM</color>, select it from <color=green>Import VRM</color> button below.

　If the avatar you downloaded is not in the import choices, it is not supported by this tool. The traditional Unity editor must be used.
Check the file format of the avatar you wish to use and confirm the upload method.</size>
