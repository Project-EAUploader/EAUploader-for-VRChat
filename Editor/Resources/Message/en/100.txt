<size=20>   The avatar file formats that this tool can handle are <color=red>.prefab and .unitypackage</color>. Many avatars are distributed in this format.
Click on the button to select the avatar you have downloaded.
If you wish to use VRM, select it from the Import VRM button below.

ã€€If your downloaded avatar is not in the import choices, it is not supported by this tool. You will need to use the traditional Unity editor.
Please check the file format of the avatar you wish to use and confirm the upload method.
