<size=20> The avatar file formats that this tool can handle are <color=red>.prefab</color> and <color=red>.unitypackage</color>. Many distributed avatars are distributed in this format.
Click on the <color=red>.unitpackage</color> button to open the selection, select the avatar you have downloaded and import it.
If you want to use <color=green>VRM</color>, select it from the <color=green>Import VRM</color> button below.

ã€€If your downloaded avatar is not in the import choices, it is not supported by this tool. You will need to use the traditional Unity editor.
Please check the file format of the avatar you wish to use and confirm the upload method.
