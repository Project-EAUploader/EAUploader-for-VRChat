<size=14>    Avatars are divided into two categories: avatars that can be used only on desktop (PCVR) and avatars that can be used on Android (Quest / Phone).
    Avatars for desktop only should select the Windows build, while those for Android should select the Android build.

    However, for the Android build, you will need to add the Android build module to Unity. Also, there are restrictions on avatars in the Android build.
    Please check if your avatar is Quest compatible and switch platforms.</size>
