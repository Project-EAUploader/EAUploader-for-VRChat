<t>Build as test</t>
<txt><size=16>
Build avatars locally (on your own PC) and make them available on VRChat.
You can test the operation of your avatar.
Avatars built as a test will not be uploaded to VRChat. Therefore, the avatar will not be visible to other players.

The avatar built as a test can be selected from "Other" among the avatars in the VRChat application.
