<t>Build as test</t>
<txt><size=16>
    Build avatars locally (on your own PC) and make them available on VRChat. You can test your avatar without uploading it. Avatars built for testing are not uploaded to VRChat. Therefore, other players will not be able to see your avatar.

    The avatar built as a test can be selected from "Other" in the avatar menu in the VRChat application.
