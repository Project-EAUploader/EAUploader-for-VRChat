<size=20>Model Management</size>

<size=14>EAUploader has simplified the management features to make it easier to manage avatars and items.
It lists all .prefabs in the project. This means that non-avatars may also be displayed.

You can "hide" avatars from the list that cannot be uploaded to VRChat, including VRM avatars.
By pressing the "Hide" button, the .prefab will be treated as hidden. You can change what is displayed in the list by clicking on the drop-down menu at the top right of the list, and you can also display objects that you have hidden.

Please use this function when objects that you do not need to display are displayed in the list.
