<size=20>VRM</size>
<size=16>VRM is a kind of file format for 3D models specialized for avatars, which can be easily created in VRoid Studio or other software.
You cannot upload to VRChat in VRM as it is, so it must be converted.

To use VRM, download the VRM Converter and import to Unity or add its repository to VCC.</size>
