    Use the vertical and horizontal bars on the left to change the viewpoint position. The currently set position is indicated by a <color=red>red dot</color> and the newly moved point is indicated by a <color=green>green dot</color>.
    On the right is a preview from the viewpoint position. If the avatar is visible, move it until the background is clear.
