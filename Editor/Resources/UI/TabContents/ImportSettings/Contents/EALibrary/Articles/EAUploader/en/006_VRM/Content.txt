<t>― Using VRM Avatars ―</t>
<txt>
<size=16> In EAUploader, you can upload VRM avatars by additionally introducing VRM Converter for VRChat.
VRM avatar is one of the standards for humanoid avatars. You cannot use VRM avatars as they are in VRChat, but you can use them by converting and uploading them.
VRM avatars can be obtained from VRoid Hub, and you can easily create them like character creation in games using VRoid Studio.

When you introduce VRM Converter for VRChat, a "Import VRM" button will be displayed in the import field. When you import, a conversion window will open. Please refer to the help in the window for the conversion.
<color=red> The converted VRM avatar requires a viewpoint position setting. Please open the viewpoint position setting from the editing tool in the "Setup" tab and adjust the viewpoint.</color>
Please refer to the help in the tool for how to set the viewpoint position.</size>

<size=20><b>〇 Supported VRM versions</b></size>
<size=16>The version of VRM is significantly different between <color=blue>VRM 0.x</color> and <color=blue>VRM 1.x</color>.
As of now (as of April 1, 2024), VRM Converter only supports <color=red>VRM 0.x version and does not support VRM 1.x version.</color>
Please be aware.
