<size=20>What this tool can do?

<color=blue>〇 Upload Avatar</color>
<color=red>✕ Modification of avatars</color></size>
<size=16>    EAUploader only supports avatars or VRMs that have already been created for VRChat and are complete; it does not support 3D models that are not for VRChat, nor does it support changing clothes, adding accessories, or changing facial expressions.
    (Editing functionality is under development as an extension.)</size>

<size=16>    Because this tool runs on Unity, any changes you make will be saved in real time. Please note that any avatar you delete from this tool will also be deleted from Unity.
    When you are finished, click the "Exit" button in the settings or close Unity.


That's all for this tool.
