<t> Detailed Explanation </t>
<txt>
The file formats supported for import are Prefab (.prefab) or Package (.unitypackage). These are file formats used for Unity.

A prefab is a collection of multiple objects (in the case of an avatar, body parts, clothes, etc.), and basically, a prefab equals the avatar body. In this tool, prefabs are considered as avatars and are managed and listed.

A package is often used when distributing assets for Unity. In the case of an avatar, the avatar body, shaders, and clothes for dressing up are bundled and distributed.

Note that you can also import by using the file while Unity is running, without using the tool's buttons.
