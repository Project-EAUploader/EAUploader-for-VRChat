<t>― Using Original Avatars ―</t>
<txt>
<size=18>Let's try modifying an avatar or creating an original avatar</size>

<size=12>The quickest way to modify an avatar is to change its clothes.
Currently, EAUploader does not support changing clothes as a standard feature.
If you want to modify an avatar excluding the extensions, you will need to use the regular Unity editor.
There are various articles published online, so please try to challenge yourself by researching.
(We plan to provide modification functions as extensions in the future.)</size>

<size=18>For those who want to create an avatar from scratch</size>

<size=12>No 3D modeling knowledge required!!
We recommend creating VRM avatars using VRoid Studio.
It's a software that allows you to easily create avatars by adjusting parameters.
You can create avatars like creating characters in games.
There are plenty of clothes available, and there are many clothes and accessories created by creators.

For the upload procedure using EAUploader for VRM avatars, please refer to the <color=blue>"Using VRM"</color> article.</size>
