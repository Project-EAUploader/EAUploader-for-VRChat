<t>― About Shaders ―</t>
<txt>
<size=18>What is a "Shader"</size>

<size=14>A shader is a "program that draws objects (such as avatars) on the screen".
By changing the shader, you can change the color and texture.
There is no need to program because you use what is already programmed.

Shaders can be imported from the <color=blue>"Import Shader"</color> on the left side of the <color=blue>"Import"</color> tab.
Some shaders are compatible with VCC and can also be imported from VCC.
Please check the imported shaders from <color=blue>"Imported Shaders"</color>. (Some VRC incompatible shaders will be excluded from the list)

<color=red>Shader installation is mandatory.</color>
Please be sure to install the shader set for the avatar. The installed shader will be automatically applied to the avatar.

<size=16>〇 If a shader error occurs after importing the avatar</size>
<color=red>Some avatars have specified shaders.</color>
There is a shader specified by the distributor, so please search for it, download it, and install it.</size>

<size=18>UnlitWF</size>

<size=14>UnlitWF/UnToon is a toon shader designed with the idea of adding various effects to the Unlit shader, which draws textures as they are.
It excels at toon drawing such as brightness/color adjustment according to light source, various effects such as NormalMap/MetallicMap/Matcap, gradation shadow/outline.
You can perform dynamic drawing with simple settings.</size>

<t>Types of Shaders</t>
<txt>
There are broad categories of shaders.
The ones often used in avatars are the standard and toon types.
Use the standard type when expressing realistic shadows,
and the toon type is often used for anime-style avatars.

The current EAUploader does not support shader changes. If you want to change or adjust the shader, please use the Unity editor.
