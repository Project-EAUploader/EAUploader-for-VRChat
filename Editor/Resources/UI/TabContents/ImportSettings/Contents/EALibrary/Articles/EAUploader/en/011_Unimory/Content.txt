<size=20>What is an Event Calendar</size>

<size=16>In VRChat, various events are held every day. If you're wondering what to do in VRChat, you might want to try participating in an event.
Events are not officially defined by VRChat. They are gatherings organized independently by users (or organizations).
The main way to announce an event is through X. Also, an information hub called the event calendar, created by volunteers, is often used. Please check each event announcement for how to participate.</size>
